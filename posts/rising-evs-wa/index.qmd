### Problem Description

##### **What You Need To Know**

<div class = "blog-text-just">

Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining serious momentum, and in Washington State, one in every six new cars sold is now electric. In fact, EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are flying off the lot at almost twice the rate compared to the rest of the U.S., according to a recent report by the Electric Power Research Institute (The Seattle Medium, 2023). These vehicles represent the future of transportation, offering not only convenience and cutting-edge technology but also substantial benefits for the environment and consumers alike.

As of 2024, Washington is home to more than 180,000 electric vehicles, with the majority concentrated in the Seattle area. So, what’s driving this shift? Let’s break down the two main types of EVs leading the charge:

1. **Battery Electric Vehicles** - are in a class of their own. Fully electric and powered by a battery and electric motor(s), these vehicles deliver instant power without the noise. They’re designed for eco-conscious drivers who prioritize features like self-driving capabilities, rapid acceleration, and the futuristic tech. BEVs are more than just cars, they’re high-tech machines that represent a new style of driving.

2. **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles** - these blend the best of both worlds, combining the tech and efficiency of EVs with the speed and power of a traditional fuel engine. PHEVs offer drivers excellent fuel efficiency while still providing the electric boost from a hybrid battery. Plus, they come equipped with many of the same advanced tech features as BEVs, like self-driving capabilities, making them a versatile choice for those looking for a little bit of everything.

##### **Why Washington State Is Leading The EV Revolution**

You might be wondering, why is Washington such a hotspot for EVs? The answer lies in the state’s forward thinking policies. In March 2020, Washington passed the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) legislation, which aims to gradually increase the number of ZEVs on the road until all new vehicles meet ZEV standards by 2035. This ambitious move has set the stage for a race among car manufacturers to create vehicles with the longest battery life, best efficiency, and most miles per charge—leading the way in innovation and sustainability.

### Data Description

<div class = "blog-text-just">

The data to conduct the analysis for this blogpost article has been extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/electric-vehicle-population/data) and this dataset was shared by a user named “Jaina”, it is titled, “Electric Vehicle Data”. It was shared in 2024 and tends to be updated quarterly. This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)

</div>

```{r}
#| label: tbl-var_desc
#| tbl-cap: "Description of necessary variables from the dataset."

# Selecting the variables necessary for data description
clean_vehicle_vars <- clean_vehicle %>%
  select(city, state, electric_vehicle_type, model_year, electric_range, vehicle_location)

# Creating a dataframe for the variables and their descriptions
var_desc <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(clean_vehicle_vars),
  Descrption = c("Name of city",
                 "Name of state",
                 "The type of elctric vehicle (BEV / PHEV)",
                 "Model year of the vehicle",
                 "Range of the electric vehicle (miles)",
                 "Geographic location of the vehicle (longitude and latitude values)")
)

# Using kableExtra to display the table in formal formatting
var_desc %>%
  kable() %>%
  row_spec(0, background = "#ede9d8")

The data cleaning was fairly straight forward as the data that was uploaded at the source was pretty well-kept. To begin with, the observations with any missing values were removed, luckily a very insignificant number of observations were lost due to this, resulting in a far more accurate analysis. Next, the necessary variables were selected after filtering for the necessary requirements for the purpose of analysis, including location. The location variable was combined together in the form of latitude and longitude, therefore some string manipulation was necessary which separated the two in order to create the interactive map.

Regarding the map in the analysis section, it sees grouped values for number of vehicles in a said location area, therefore the numbers end up being quite large. Since the observations are mapped according to the size which dictates the radius of the circle, there needed to be a better way to display the concentration of EVs in a location. Hence, the grouped data was aggregated by a logarithmic 10 scale.

<div class = "figure-desc">

@fig-leaflet highlights the concentration of EVs across Washington State, showing that the highest populations of these vehicles are clustered around major cities like Seattle, Portland, and Spokane.

</div>

<div class = "blog-text-just">

In @fig-leaflet, it can be seen that the distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) across Washington State. The spread is somewhat scattered, but there are clear clusters in areas like Seattle, Spokane, and Portland. Seattle, as a hub of technology and innovation, is home to multinational corporations (MNCs) like Oracle and Amazon, both of which offer perks like rebates or free charging stations for employees who own an EV. It's no surprise that a large portion of EV owners in this area are either part of higher-income households or are eco-conscious consumers looking to make a difference.

But why are there so many EVs in Washington? Well, in mid-2023, Washington introduced an EV instant rebate program, offering between $2,500 to $9,000 toward the purchase or lease of an EV (Washington State Department of Commerce, 2024). The program aims to issue around 6,500 to 8,000 rebates, making it one of the first low-cost EV lease programs in the U.S. With initiatives like these, the state is rapidly increasing its share of EVs on the road.

<div class = "figure-desc">

@fig-lineplot shows the rising number of BEV and PHEV sales over time, with a particular spike in 2023, coinciding with new government rebate programs.

</div>

<div class = blog-text-just>

Looking at @fig-lineplot, it can be noticed that a consistent rise in EV sales over time for both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). One thing that stands out is the absence of these vehicles before 2008, despite the popularity of hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius in the early 2000s. This is because BEVs and PHEVs as we know them today didn't really hit the market until around 2010, when the Nissan Leaf became the first globally-marketed BEV and the BYD F3DM made its debut as the first PHEV.

The spike in EV sales in 2023 is particularly noticeable, as many consumers “jumped the gun” to take advantage of the new government rebates. While BEVs continue to dominate, PHEVs are also seeing significant growth, with more PHEVs being registered in 2024 than BEVs, showing that consumer interest is expanding in both types of vehicles.

</div>

### Conclusion

<div class = blog-text-just>

Electric vehicles are rapidly gaining popularity in Washington State, driven by forward-thinking policies like the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) legislation and government rebates. Washington has emerged as a leader in EV adoption, with one in every six new vehicles sold now being electric. This trend shows no signs of slowing, especially as the state continues to push for all new vehicle sales to meet ZEV standards by 2035.

The analysis highlighted key factors behind this growth, such as incentives from large corporations and the recent introduction of rebate programs that have sparked a surge in EV sales, particularly in 2023. The data also revealed a significant increase in both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), with PHEVs gaining even more ground in 2024.

Looking forward, the ZEV legislation will not only shape consumer behavior but also challenge manufacturers to innovate, ensuring their vehicles can meet the new standards of traveling at least 50 miles on battery power alone. According to Vega-Perkins et al. (2023), EVs have the potential to significantly reduce energy burdens, making this shift not just about adopting new technology, but also about working toward a more sustainable, lower-emission future. Ultimately, as the U.S. strives to accelerate EV adoption, Washington sets a strong example of how these changes can positively impact both the environment and the economy.
