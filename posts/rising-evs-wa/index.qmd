title: "The Rise of Electric Vehicles in Washington State, USA"
description: |
  Electric vehicles are rapidly increasing in the state of Washington, where one in six new cars
  sold is now electric. This growth is driven by state incentives such as rebates and a new Zero
  Emission Vehicle (ZEV) legislature.

### Problem Description

<div class = "blog-text-just">

Electric vehicles are on the rise and every one in six new vehicles sold in Washington State is now an electric vehicle. Electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (HEVs) have been selling almost twice as quickly in Washington State (WA) than in the rest of the country, according to the findings of Electric Power Research Institute (The Seattle Medium, 2023). These EVs and HEVs are the future of transportation on land, bringing forth not only immense sales but benefits to our planet and to consumers as well. As of 2024, there are over 180,000 EVs in Washington with the majority of them being focused around Seattle. Now there are two main types of EVs we should be concerning ourselves with:

1. **Battery Electric Vehicles** - These vehicles are off the bat, a category of their own, and are fully electric and powered through a battery along with an electric motor. This allows it to produce instant power, no noise. Furthermore, there are very advanced technological features within the car as these vehicles are targeted at a demographic that is environmentally cautious, prefers self-driving vehicles, and wants instant power and speed.

2. **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles** - The concepts and technologies of regular EVs can also be implemented into traditional fuel powered cars. These unique breeds of cars provide customers with various bonuses such as excellent fuel efficiency, an engine for speed and a hybrid battery for power, and various high technological features including self driving.

One might wonder, why are EVs becoming so abundant in the state of Washington, and is this to follow within the entirety of the United States? When it comes to Seattle and WA, the state has recently passed a new legislature in March of 2020 by the name of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). This legislature aims to gradually increase the number of ZEVs sold until all new vehicles meet this new standard by 2035. There is a massive race ahead of us where car manufacturers will aim to gain the absolute highest number of battery efficiency and life, whilst ensuring to maximize the number of kilometers/miles the vehicle will travel.

### Data Description

<div class = "blog-text-just">

The data to conduct the analysis for this blogpost article has been extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/electric-vehicle-population/data) and this dataset was shared by a user named “Jaina”, it is titled, “Electric Vehicle Data”. It was shared in 2024 and tends to be updated quarterly. 

</div>

```{r}

# clean_vehicle_vars <- select()

```


### Analysis

```{r}
#| cache: true

# Create a spatial data frame from the clean_vehicle data
clean_vehicle_sf <- st_as_sf(clean_vehicle, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)

# Create a grid over the area with a specific cell size (e.g., 0.05 degrees)
grid <- st_make_grid(clean_vehicle_sf, cellsize = 0.05, square = TRUE)

# Convert the grid to an sf object
grid_sf <- st_as_sf(grid)

# Perform a spatial join to count the number of vehicles in each grid cell
grid_counts <- st_join(clean_vehicle_sf, grid_sf, join = st_intersects)
grid_counts <- grid_counts %>%
  group_by(geometry) %>%  # Group by the grid cells
  summarize(count = n()) %>%  # Count the number of vehicles in each grid cell
  st_as_sf()

cities <- data.frame(
  city = c("Seattle", "Olympia", "Tacoma", "Spokane"),
  lat = c(47.6062, 47.0379, 47.2529, 47.4588),
  lon = c(-122.3321, -122.9007, -122.4443, -117.4360)
)

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-leaflet
#| fig-cap: "Locations and densities of EVs in Washington State"

# Plot the result using Leaflet
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = -120, lat = 47, zoom = 6) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data = grid_counts,
                   lng = ~st_coordinates(geometry)[, 1],
                   lat = ~st_coordinates(geometry)[, 2],
                   radius = ~log10(count),  # Circle size proportional to the count
                   color = "red",
                   fillOpacity = 0.7,
                   popup = ~paste("EV Count:", count)) %>%
  # Add city labels
  addLabelOnlyMarkers(data = cities,
                      lng = ~lon,
                      lat = ~lat,

                        "font-weight" = "bold"
                      ))) %>%
  addLegend("topright",
            colors = "red",

Figure 1 above is a map of Washington State and it is showing the density and concentration of EVs in certain locations around the state. It is evident that the major cities within the state are where most of these vehicles are situated.

In @fig-leaflet, the distribution of EVs around Washington State is relatively scattered except for a few particular areas, such as: Seattle, Spokane, and Portland. Being a technological haven of innovation and advancement of many multinational corporations within the US, Seattle sees a lot of these MNCs based around this area offer incentives to their employees that own an electric vehicle such as rebates or free charging stations, namely Oracle and Amazon provide this. The individuals that own an EV are either of high income earning households and are able to afford some of the steep prices or are those that tend to be more environmentally conscious.

Coming back to the question, why are there so many electric vehicles in Washington? In mid-2023, the state of Washington announced an EV instant rebate program where the local government aimed to provide 6500-8000 rebates between $2500-$9000 towards purchasing or leasing EVs (Washington State Department of Commerce, 2024). With this, the local government has successfully introduced one of the first low cost EV lease programs within the US and hopes to achieve a higher percentage of EVs present in the market.
