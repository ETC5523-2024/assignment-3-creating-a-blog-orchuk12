My name is Rayyan Aamir Shekhani, however, people often call me Shekhani or Johnson. I come from Pakistan but I have never lived there as I've been an international baby my whole life! I aspire to visit every continent by the time I'm 30 years old (including Antarctica!) because I love the different cultures that people belong to.

I like games, cars, and coffee. I spent quite some time playing Counter-Strike and League of Legends, they are two of my favorite games. I am a crazy car enthusiast, one of my current favorites has got to be the Ferrari 296 GTB, purely for its (aes)thetics. And lastly, espressos are the only form coffee to drink because it is the only way you extract the maximum taste of the beans that shot of coffee is made of!
