    "text": "Problem Description\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are gaining serious momentum, and in Washington State, one in every six new cars sold is now electric. In fact, EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are flying off the lot at almost twice the rate compared to the rest of the U.S., according to a recent report by the Electric Power Research Institute (The Seattle Medium, 2023). These vehicles represent the future of transportation, offering not only convenience and cutting-edge technology but also substantial benefits for the environment and consumers alike.\nAs of 2024, Washington is home to more than 180,000 electric vehicles, with the majority concentrated in the Seattle area. So, what’s driving this shift? Let’s break down the two main types of EVs leading the charge:\n\nBattery Electric Vehicles - are in a class of their own. Fully electric and powered by a battery and electric motor(s), these vehicles deliver instant power without the noise. They’re designed for eco-conscious drivers who prioritize features like self-driving capabilities, rapid acceleration, and the futuristic tech. BEVs are more than just cars, they’re high-tech machines that represent a new style of driving.\nPlug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles - these blend the best of both worlds, combining the tech and efficiency of EVs with the speed and power of a traditional fuel engine. PHEVs offer drivers excellent fuel efficiency while still providing the electric boost from a hybrid battery. Plus, they come equipped with many of the same advanced tech features as BEVs, like self-driving capabilities, making them a versatile choice for those looking for a little bit of everything.\n\n\nWhy Washington State Is Leading The EV Revolution\nYou might be wondering, why is Washington such a hotspot for EVs? The answer lies in the state’s forward thinking policies. In March 2020, Washington passed the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) legislation, which aims to gradually increase the number of ZEVs on the road until all new vehicles meet ZEV standards by 2035. This ambitious move has set the stage for a race among car manufacturers to create vehicles with the longest battery life, best efficiency, and most miles per charge—leading the way in innovation and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Description\n\nThe data to conduct the analysis for this blogpost article has been extracted from Kaggle and this dataset was shared by a user named “Jaina”, it is titled, “Electric Vehicle Data”. It was shared in 2024 and tends to be updated quarterly.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Description of necessary variables from the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescrption\n\n\n\n\ncity\nName of city\n\n\nstate\nName of state\n\n\nelectric_vehicle_type\nThe type of elctric vehicle (BEV / PHEV)\n\n\nmodel_year\nModel year of the vehicle\n\n\nelectric_range\nRange of the electric vehicle (miles)\n\n\nvehicle_location\nGeographic location of the vehicle (longitude and latitude values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data cleaning was fairly straight forward as the data that was uploaded at the source was pretty well-kept. To begin with, the observations with any missing values were removed, luckily a very insignificant number of observations were lost due to this, resulting in a far more accurate analysis. Next, the necessary variables were selected after filtering for the necessary requirements for the purpose of analysis, including location. The location variable was combined together in the form of latitude and longitude, therefore some string manipulation was necessary which separated the two in order to create the interactive map.\nRegarding the map in the analysis section, it sees grouped values for number of vehicles in a said location area, therefore the numbers end up being quite large. Since the observations are mapped according to the size which dictates the radius of the circle, there needed to be a better way to display the concentration of EVs in a location. Hence, the grouped data was aggregated by log10 scale.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of Registered EVs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 above shows the aggregated number of EVs spread across Washington State. The map above is demonstrating the locations where the populations of these vehicles is at its highest. It shows patterns that a big chunk of these cars are registered around major towns and cities such as: Seattle, Portland, and Spokane.\n\n\nIn Figure 1, the distribution of EVs around Washington State is relatively scattered except for a few particular areas, such as: Seattle, Spokane, and Portland. Being a technological haven of innovation and advancement of many multinational corporations within the US, Seattle sees a lot of these MNCs based around this area offer incentives to their employees that own an electric vehicle such as rebates or free charging stations, namely Oracle and Amazon provide this. The individuals that own an EV are either of high income earning households and are able to afford some of the steep prices or are those that tend to be more environmentally conscious.\nComing back to the question, why are there so many electric vehicles in Washington? In mid-2023, the state of Washington announced an EV instant rebate program where the local government aimed to provide 6500-8000 rebates between $2500-$9000 towards purchasing or leasing EVs (Washington State Department of Commerce, 2024). With this, the local government has successfully introduced one of the first low cost EV lease programs within the US and hopes to achieve a higher percentage of EVs present in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Rising EV Sales Over Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 above shows the number of BEVs and PHEVs sold over time. The plot aims to illustrate the rising numbers and helps to identify patterns in the number of sales. The goal is to notice the significant rise in sales for 2023.\n\n\nAbove in Figure 2, and we can see that the overall number of sales has been increasing over time, for both types of EVs. One odd thing that might be noticed is that there appears to be no BEVs or PHEVs prior to 2008, even though popular hybrid-vehicles such as the Toyota Prius have been popular since the early 2000s. This is because these new classifications were introduced when the BYD F3DM was launched in China, and marketed as the “first PHEV”, whilst equally in around 2010, the Nissan Leaf was the first globally marketed BEV which really kicked things off in this industry.\nFigure 2 also demonstrates that there is a significant rise in both types of EVs in 2023, which indicates the behaviour of consumers that “jumped the gun” and took advantage of these new rebates offered by the local government. We also notice that although PHEVs are lesser in numbers compared to true BEVs, they are still showing immense growth over the years and especially during 2024 where it appears that there are more PHEVs registered than BEVs.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nElectric vehicles continue becoming popular, their abundance around the state of Washington continues to grow. With the implementation of the ZEV legislation and the rebates provided to the population, Washington State is well positioned and on its way to achieving the target of all new vehicles sold to be a ZEV by 2035.\nThis brings forth also an entirely new perspective to the game, as manufacturers are also going to be pushed to ensure that their vehicles meet the criteria for a vehicle to be classified as a ZEV, which is that the vehicle must be able to travel at least 50 miles on battery power alone! Studies indicate that EVs can significantly reduce energy burdens and thus, in conclusion, this is all a push towards adapting to these new changes and working towards achieving lower carbon emissions in the state (Vega-Perkins et al., 2023). The US must aim to accelerate the EV adoption rates along with getting the population accustomed to driving electric vehicles for when they are the only vehicles around.\n\n\n\nReferences\nEV Instant Rebate Program - Washington State Department of Commerce.
