I come from Pakistan but I have never lived there as I’ve been an international baby my whole life! I aspire to visit every continent by the time I’m 30 years old (including Antarctica!) because I love the different cultures that people belong to.\nI like games, cars, and coffee. I spent quite some time playing Counter-Strike and League of Legends, they are two of my favorite games. I am a crazy car enthusiast, one of my current favorites has got to be the Ferrari 296 GTB, purely for its (aes)thetics. And lastly, espressos are the only form coffee to drink because it is the only way you extract the maximum taste of the beans that shot of coffee is made of!"

    "text": "Problem Description\n\nElectric vehicles are on the rise and every one in six new vehicles sold in Washington State is now an electric vehicle. Electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (HEVs) have been selling almost twice as quickly in Washington State (WA) than in the rest of the country, according to the findings of Electric Power Research Institute (The Seattle Medium, 2023). These EVs and HEVs are the future of transportation on land, bringing forth not only immense sales but benefits to our planet and to consumers as well. As of 2024, there are over 180,000 EVs in Washington with the majority of them being focused around Seattle. Now there are two main types of EVs we should be concerning ourselves with:\n\nBattery Electric Vehicles - These vehicles are off the bat, a category of their own, and are fully electric and powered through a battery along with an electric motor. This allows it to produce instant power, no noise. Furthermore, there are very advanced technological features within the car as these vehicles are targeted at a demographic that is environmentally cautious, prefers self-driving vehicles, and wants instant power and speed.\nPlug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles - The concepts and technologies of regular EVs can also be implemented into traditional fuel powered cars. These unique breeds of cars provide customers with various bonuses such as excellent fuel efficiency, an engine for speed and a hybrid battery for power, and various high technological features including self driving.\n\nOne might wonder, why are EVs becoming so abundant in the state of Washington, and is this to follow within the entirety of the United States? When it comes to Seattle and WA, the state has recently passed a new legislature in March of 2020 by the name of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). This legislature aims to gradually increase the number of ZEVs sold until all new vehicles meet this new standard by 2035. There is a massive race ahead of us where car manufacturers will aim to gain the absolute highest number of battery efficiency and life, whilst ensuring to maximize the number of kilometers/miles the vehicle will travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Description\n\nThe data to conduct the analysis for this blogpost article has been extracted from Kaggle and this dataset was shared by a user named “Jaina”, it is titled, “Electric Vehicle Data”. It was shared in 2024 and tends to be updated quarterly.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Locations and densities of EVs in Washington State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 above is a map of Washington State and it is showing the density and concentration of EVs in certain locations around the state. It is evident that the major cities within the state are where most of these vehicles are situated.\n\n\nIn Figure 1, the distribution of EVs around Washington State is relatively scattered except for a few particular areas, such as: Seattle, Spokane, and Portland. Being a technological haven of innovation and advancement of many multinational corporations within the US, Seattle sees a lot of these MNCs based around this area offer incentives to their employees that own an electric vehicle such as rebates or free charging stations, namely Oracle and Amazon provide this. The individuals that own an EV are either of high income earning households and are able to afford some of the steep prices or are those that tend to be more environmentally conscious.\nComing back to the question, why are there so many electric vehicles in Washington? In mid-2023, the state of Washington announced an EV instant rebate program where the local government aimed to provide 6500-8000 rebates between $2500-$9000 towards purchasing or leasing EVs (Washington State Department of Commerce, 2024). With this, the local government has successfully introduced one of the first low cost EV lease programs within the US and hopes to achieve a higher percentage of EVs present in the market."
